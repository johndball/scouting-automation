# Troop Automation Playbook (Apps Script)

A sanitized, copy/paste-ready set of Google Apps Script projects for Scouting units.

**Includes**
- All Y’all Weekly Digest (calendar → approvals → email)
- RSVP & Transportation (drivers/towing matrix, GREEN/RED flags)
- Leader & Scout Self‑Service Portals (uploads, advancements, notifications)
- Shared libs (Config loader, installer/triggers)
- Tools (sanitizer)

## Quick Start
1. Create the Drive folder layout and a **Config** Google Sheet (see `docs/01-overview-setup.md`).
2. Copy `shared-libs/*.gs` into your Apps Script projects.
3. Run **Install/Repair Triggers** from the menu.
4. Use `tools/sanitizer/` before publishing forks.
